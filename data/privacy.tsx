3.5.5 Facebook Pixel

In order to use Facebook campaigns in a needs-based manner, to further optimize them, and to measure their conversion, we use an individual so-called visitor action pixel from Facebook Ireland Ltd. an individual so-called visitor action pixel from Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook") on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR in conjunction with § 25 Abs.1 S.1 TTDSG. This pixel is integrated into the code of our platform. On the one hand, this allows us to ensure that the Facebook ads we initiate are only displayed to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our offer. In this way, we want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the respective user and do not annoy him.

This helps us measure the conversion of the respective campaign for statistical, market research and billing purposes. The following information is processed during the deployment:

Timestamp,

URL,

campaign-related information (especially specification of the impression, form field, activated button).

The data collected in this way is anonymous for us and therefore does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the identity of the respective user. If you log into your Facebook account after activating the pixel or if you visit our website while logged in, it is possible that this data will be stored and processed by Facebook, which we would like to inform you about here. Facebook may link this data to your Facebook account and also use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook's data usage policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. You can find more information about the Facebook Pixel here. You may allow Facebook and its partners to serve ads on and off Facebook. You can opt out of this specific data processing at any time by adjusting your Facebook settings accordingly. Please be aware that the declared objection only applies to the respective device used.

Where anonymized data processing is not possible, we also process your personal data from sections 3.1 to 3.5 to run our business (e.g., to perform administrative and organizational processes), to monitor and analyze our offerings, and to improve our offerings to you. In addition, we use your personal data to promote and develop our business relationship with you, to identify services that may be of interest to you, to carry out business development activities, to send you publications and communications or to invite you to events. 

The legal basis for the purposes described above is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR, provided that your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail. You can object to this data processing at any time. To do so, please use the contact options of our data protection officer in section 2 ("Who is responsible for processing your personal data and how can you contact us?") of this privacy policy.

In addition, we process your personal data if we have a legal obligation to do so (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c) GDPR).

4. With whom do we share your personal data?

Where necessary or appropriate for our services or to fulfill the purposes defined in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose to third parties (such as service providers, consultants, related parties, courts, authorities and others) in Switzerland, the EU or other countries your personal data that we collect, for example, in the course of providing our services, when you contact us or when you visit our site. 

In addition, we work with third parties who provide services to us and may share your personal information with those third parties in connection with the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, for example, banks, CRM tool providers, payment processing service providers, or IT providers who may have access to your personal information at our direction or in software support. 

Detailed information about the service providers we use in connection with user and customer support (see section 3.4, "User and customer support") as well as our online presence and website optimization (see section 3.5, "Online presence and website optimization") can be found in the corresponding sections of this privacy policy.

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if:

You have given your consent to do so, where required, or the organization for which you work has received your consent to do so, where required;

we are required to do so by legal, regulatory or business obligations;

this is necessary in connection with a company sale, merger, restructuring, dissolution or similar events, as well as in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar events;

this is necessary in connection with legal proceedings, or to assert or defend claims.

5. Are the recipients of your personal data located outside of Switzerland or the EU?

We may also transfer your personal data to recipients located outside of Switzerland, the European Union ("EU") or the European Economic Area ("EEA"). This applies in particular to the aforementioned processing to analysis or targeting technologies, which may result in a transfer of data to the servers of the service providers. Other recipients may be affiliated service providers that we need to provide our services, e.g. hosters, CRM tools, analytics service providers, job posting portals for multi-posting or tendering companies. These servers may be located outside of Switzerland, the EU or the EEA, in particular in the USA. 

We take great care to ensure that our service providers and other recipients of your data meet data protection standards that are equivalent to those of the DPA and the GDPR and that the applicable guidelines are adhered to. For example, we only transfer your data to recipients that are located in a country that has been recognized by the competent authority (in Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (or the Federal Council) and in the EU, the European Commission) as a country with adequate data protection. If a recipient is located in a country that is not recognized as adequate, such as the U.S., we take further protective measures in accordance with applicable data protection laws or have these recipients provide us with appropriate contractual guarantees that ensure compliance with these Swiss and EU standards and the enforcement of data subject rights, for example, based on so-called standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or the FDPIC.

6. How long do we keep your personal data?

In principle, your personal data will only be processed and stored by us for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected (see in detail section 3, "Why and on what legal basis do we process your personal data and with whom do we share it?") or we are legally obliged to do so.

Therefore, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, among other things:

Personal data processed for the purpose of fulfilling a contract concluded between JOIN and you will be stored at least until the complete fulfillment of this contract.

Personal data processed to safeguard the legitimate interests of JOIN (e.g. as part of the provision of our site, for user and customer support, for the further development of our offer, etc.) will be retained for as long as is necessary to fulfill these purposes.

In addition, JOIN is permitted to store personal data for a longer period of time if you have consented, as long as the consent is not revoked, or if this is necessary to fulfill a legal (storage) obligation (for example, accounting regulations or tax law) or by order of an authority or in the context of a procedure.

After expiration of the retention period (usually six to ten years after the end of the contract), your personal data will be deleted, unless JOIN has a legitimate interest to keep your data.

7. What rights do you have in relation to your personal data?

7.1 Overview

You may exercise various rights with respect to your data processed by JOIN.

Specifically, you have the right to do the following:

Receive information regarding the processed data. You have the right to know whether data is processed by JOIN, to receive information about individual aspects of the processing and to receive a copy of the data.

In the case of transfers of your data abroad, the right of access or reference to the appropriate or adequate safeguards and how to obtain a copy of them or where they are available,

Verify and have it corrected. You have the right to verify the accuracy of your data and request that it be updated or corrected.

Request restriction of processing. You have the right to restrict the processing of your data under certain circumstances.

Request deletion or other removal of the personal data. You have the right to request the deletion of your data under certain circumstances.

You have the right to receive your data and have it transferred to another person responsible. You have the right to receive your data in a structured, common and machine-readable format and, if technically possible, to have it transferred to another controller without hindrance.

If you have consented to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, you may withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. If you inform us that you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process your personal data for these specific purposes, unless there is another legitimate interest.

You can exercise your rights by e-mail in accordance with section 2 ("Who is responsible for processing your personal data and how can you contact us?") of this Privacy Policy directly to our Data Protection Officer. We have the right, in such a case, to request information from you to verify your identity.

7.2 Right of objection

The general right to object applies to all processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy that are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

However, we may continue to process your personal data if we can demonstrate a legitimate interest that outweighs your interests, fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights.

In addition, it is possible to contact the supervisory authority responsible for this case, the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Friedrichstrasse 219, 10969 Berlin.

8. How do we protect your data?

We use the highest standards of information security for our infrastructure and the processing of your data. For example, we use protective mechanisms for computers, such as firewalls and data encryption. Physical access controls apply to our buildings and data. Access to our customers' personal data is restricted to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.

All data transmitted by you personally, including your payment data, will also be transmitted using the generally accepted and secure standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL is a secure and proven standard that is also used, for example, in online banking. You can recognize a secure SSL connection by the s appended to http (i.e. https://...) in the address bar of your browser or by the lock symbol in the lower area of the browser.

We also use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data stored with us against manipulation, partial or complete loss and against unauthorized access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously monitored in accordance with technological developments, regularly adapted to the respective risk and improved if necessary.
